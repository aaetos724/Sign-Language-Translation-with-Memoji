# Sign-Language-Translation-with-Memoji
In line with Apple's commitment to accessibility, my idea proposes an innovative solution that leverages the Memoji feature to facilitate communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. This project aims to develop a system where Memoji avatars can record sign language gestures and translate them into real-time voice translations, enabling seamless communication between sign language users and those who do not know sign language.
Key Features:
1. Sign Language Recognition with Memoji
2. Voice Translation in Real-Time
3. User Experience Focused on Inclusivity:
Impact and Potential Use Cases:
* Education: Deaf students could use this system to communicate with teachers and peers who do not know sign language, making learning more inclusive.
* Workplaces: Deaf employees could use this technology in meetings, ensuring they can participate in real-time conversations without relying on interpreters or extra equipment.
* Social Integration: Social interactions between the deaf and non-deaf community would be significantly easier, helping to break down communication barriers.
